# Analyze Claude Code Conversations

You are tasked with analyzing Claude Code conversation history to create comprehensive summaries of what was accomplished and how Claude Code helped.

## Your Mission

Systematically process ALL conversations in `/Users/vladgheorghe/.claude/projects/` and generate intelligent summaries focusing on:

1. **What specific tasks were completed**
2. **What problems were solved** 
3. **How Claude Code's tools and capabilities were used**
4. **The overall outcome/value delivered**

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Explore the full directory structure
!ls -la /Users/vladgheorghe/.claude/projects/
```

### 2. Initialize Tracking
Create `processed_conversations.json` to track which conversations you've analyzed:
```json
[]
```

### 3. Use Task Agents for Batch Processing
**CRITICAL:** Don't process conversations one-by-one. Use Task agents to handle entire projects:

```
Task(
  description="Analyze [PROJECT-NAME] conversations", 
  prompt="Read and analyze ALL conversation files in /Users/vladgheorghe/.claude/projects/[PROJECT-DIR]/ and create intelligent summaries.

  For EACH conversation file (.jsonl), provide:
  - Project context and goals
  - Specific tasks completed
  - Problems solved  
  - Claude Code tools used
  - Value delivered

  Files to analyze: [LIST ALL .jsonl FILES]
  
  This is critical - analyze EVERY conversation file, not just summaries."
)
```

### 4. Process in Logical Batches

**Batch 1: Major Projects (5-7 conversations each)**
- finchat (personal finance automation)
- ml-agent (machine learning systems)  
- script-parser (media processing)

**Batch 2: Development Tools (2-3 conversations each)**
- ai-trader-frontend (trading dashboard)
- airflow-manager (data pipeline orchestration)
- maven-launchpad (course content analysis)

**Batch 3: Sandbox Projects (1-4 conversations each)**
- sandbox-ai-slides (presentation system)
- sandbox-hf-mcp (dataset management)
- sandbox-menuchat (menu extraction)
- sandbox-openai-responses-bug (API testing)
- sandbox-opus-vg (3D game development)

**Batch 4: Repository Management & Misc (1-15 conversations)**
- code directory (GitHub repository creation)
- mcp projects (MCP server development)
- standalone projects

### 5. Create Summary Files

For each project/batch, create `summary_[project-name].md` with this structure:

```markdown
# [Project Name]: Claude Code Conversation Analysis

## Overview
[Brief project description]

## Individual Conversation Summaries

### Conversation 1: [Title]
**File:** `[conversation-id].jsonl`

**Tasks Completed:**
- [Specific accomplishment 1]
- [Specific accomplishment 2]

**Problems Solved:**
- [Problem and solution description]

**Claude Code Tools Used:**
- [Tool]: [How it was used]
- [Tool]: [How it was used]

**Value Delivered:**
[Quantifiable impact and benefits]

## Overall Project Impact
[High-level value summary]
```

### 6. Update Tracking After Each Batch

After processing each batch, update `processed_conversations.json`:
```json
[
  "/Users/vladgheorghe/.claude/projects/[project]/[file1].jsonl",
  "/Users/vladgheorghe/.claude/projects/[project]/[file2].jsonl"
]
```

### 7. Quality Control

Ensure complete coverage:
- Count total conversations in directory structure  
- Count entries in tracking file
- Verify numbers match (~70 total conversations across ~25 projects)

## Success Criteria

✅ **Complete Coverage:** All ~70 conversations analyzed  
✅ **Intelligent Analysis:** Focus on business value, not just tool usage  
✅ **Systematic Tracking:** Every conversation file recorded  
✅ **Structured Output:** 7-10 summary markdown files  
✅ **Replicable Process:** Another agent could follow the same steps  

## Time Investment
- Setup: 15 minutes
- Batch processing: 30-45 minutes  
- Quality control: 15 minutes
- **Total: ~60-75 minutes for complete analysis**

## Critical Success Patterns

**DO:**
- Use Task agents for batch processing (20-30 conversations per agent)
- Focus on what was accomplished and value delivered
- Track at conversation file level
- Process in logical project groupings

**DON'T:**
- Process conversations individually 
- Only extract metadata/basic stats
- Track at project level only
- Process randomly without system
